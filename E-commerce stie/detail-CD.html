The show follows the two main characters, Aquamarine, who mainly goes by Aqua, and Ruby. They are the children of Ai Hoshino, who is a famous idol of the idol group B-Komachi. Two things to mention regarding their mother: firstly, as an idol, having any sort of relationship is frowned upon; and secondly, when she got pregnant, she was 16 years old. Due to these factors, her pregnancy is kept under wraps. Only her manager and the doctor, Gorou Amamiya, are in the know. However, one day when the doctor is getting some fresh air, he is murdered by a stalker who somehow knows Ai Hoshino is pregnant and at the hospital. As Gorou Amamiya is fading away, he then wakes up as baby Aquamarine. Gorou Amamiya is somehow reborn as the idol’s son and has all the memories of his past life, and in an even stranger turn of events, Ruby also retains her memories of her past life.
